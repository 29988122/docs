# Governance Implementation Panel Transcript 
This is the transcript from the Governance Implementation panel that was organized by SCRF as part of the Smart Contract Summit. You can read more about the panel, the panelists, and the topic more broadly, check out the [forum post](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/smart-contract-summit-2021-governance-implementation-panel/621).



**Eugene Leventhal:**
Thank you for joining us today for our panel on governance implementation projects. And today we have a great panel lined up. And I'm just going to quickly just hand it off to our moderator for the panel, who is Kelsie Nabben. So Kelsie, please feel free to take it away.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Hello. And thank you for having me. [00:27] So my name is Kelsie. I'm a researcher at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. I'm connected with the Center for Automated Decision-Making and Society as well as the Blockchain Innovation Hub, and Digital Ethnography Research Center. So I have the pleasure of handing around the virtual room to introduce each of our panelists today and hopefully helping to facilitate a really engaging discussion on governance implementation and what's happening with DAO’s [Decentralized Autonomous Organization] in the blockchain space. So starting with Connor, please tell us a little bit more about yourself and what that has to do with DAOs.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
Thanks, Kelsie. [1:06] Yeah. So formerly a lawyer. Helped co-found the Blockchain Association, back a few years ago. Now the biggest industry in lobbying association in United States for blockchain. And on the DAO side really got it, particularly interested when I wrote an article with Jesse Walden around scaling crypto companies and looking to the precedent of cooperatives in order to think through some of the principles that we might apply in scaling crypto companies. And then thought more critically about actually, how could we start having DAOs come together to jointly fund research and ultimately end up funding the DAO research cooperative. We're doing just that.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Excellent. Leighton?

**Leighton Cusak:**
Yeah. Well, now, Connor I can say I've read that article. That was a really good article. Yeah. So yeah. [1:55] My name is Leighton. And I'm involved in a few different DAOs. PoolTogether is one that I'm probably most heavily involved in. And that's a protocol that moved to tokenized governance in February of this year. So that's the one that I'm still most heavily involved in, but additionally to that I'm involved in Venture DAO which is an on chain essentially, Angel Investment Group. And then a DAO called Pleasr DAO, which is a NFT [Nonfungible Token] art collection DAO. So that's my experiences as relevant to DAOs.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Great to have you here. Scott Moore, tell us a little bit more about yourself?

**Scott Moore:**
Awesome. Hey, everyone. [2:32] My name is Scott. Currently, I'm a co-founder of a project called Gitcoin, which was started in 2017 with the goal of hopefully finding open-source software development for the time being that is meant mostly running public goods and the Web 3 ecosystem. Recently we've exited to community towards that goal. My history before Gitcoin actually involved a bit around DAO’s in  2015 - 16 with a project that shortly after unrelated to the DAO hack ended up not really being very interesting as people sort of started to think more deeply about what we were trying to do with DAOs now it really feels like, although we're not there yet it's been a lot of progress which is awesome. So excited to talk with that. And Seth I'll maybe pass it to you.

**Seth Frey:**
Hi, there. [3:16] My name is Seth Frey. I'm a professor at the University of California, Davis. And I specialize in the study of governance systems, mostly online governance systems like World of Warcraft communities, self-hosted Minecraft servers, subreddit, reddit communities. I was trained originally as a cognitive scientist. To do cognitive science to understand people you need thousands, or hundreds, or maybe millions of people and you got to be able to compare them. So from my perspective to do social science, to study societies, you need a societal unit of analysis, need new opportunities to study lots of independent instantiations of communities or in my case governance systems. And so the proliferation of DAOs and the very frothy high iteration, exploration that's happening in this community is a lot of what's brought me here today.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Thanks. Look forward to exploring that more. Rich Brown?

**Richard Brown:**
[4:16] Hi, my name is Rich Brown. Currently am the co-founder of the Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF). It's a venue devoted to connecting researchers, academics and industry together to push the space forward. Previously I was the head of community at MakerDAO for three, four years. Helped architects basically all the things that were traditionally related to community, but also a significant amount of time spent in the proto-governance stage of MakerDAO, so I have some insights into some of the mechanism designs there. Before that I co-founded a multi-stakeholder cooperative in the real world. It's no more real business with 1500 photographers which is still running today. And before that I ran a 300 person pirate corporation in EVE Online, which free you might or Seth you might have some insights into it where I learned most of my community building skills actually. I've just been coasting on since then. So that's my thing.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[5:23] It's interesting that you should mention online cooperatives in relation to your kind of DAO resume. So why would or wouldn't communities want to consider a DAO? And why is it now that blockchain communities are really kind of interested in investing in governance?

**Scott Moore:**
[5:42] So I definitely think that the metaverse conversations we're bringing up here with EVE Online and world of Warcraft and so forth is pretty relevant here. Especially during the pandemic I think people started to really understand the reasoning behind the popularity of those sorts of organizations, I guess bringing short of roughly more fringe group earlier on already did. I definitely also grew up to playing World of War Craft and like help run guilds and raids and so forth that experience was formative to the point where it didn't seem strange to me to interact with a whole bunch of random people that I don't know online towards some common goal. So the idea of like the Ethereum ecosystem never really seemed that strange to me. And it's interesting that it does seem strange where like pirate corporate did seem strange to some people. But I think now there's a lot more understanding of, the ability for people to coordinate online being like a core primitive of just like where we're at as a society.

**Scott Moore:**
[6:43] I think that it's naturally one of the kind of thing that progresses over time. We probably still have a lot of work to do in terms of like, when we talk about people creating DAO is the question is, what is a DAO? And I don't think we're there yet in terms of really having like, to something that Rich was saying this before we had sort of a formal definition of like, what or instantiation what a digital cooperative should be in the future? But I think we're certainly making a lot of progress there. And I think that the there's certainly been an acceleration just in this general idea of people coordinating online to generate value and normalized thing. The other last example of this stuff is Roblox, which is like, now obviously a public company, now obviously very popular and like, even I think that's part of the reason we're seeing like traditional Web 2 folks like, even the standards of “DC Twitter” folks like now caring about this space. I'll pause there, but that's certainly been my journey I guess. I think to me one of the reasons we're seeing so much popularity in this concept now.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[7:56] I think just jumping a little on Scott's thought. You alluded to it as you were enjoying Kelsie and we also had Rich talked about his participation both in with online communities and then in cooperatives. Like it just strikes me that a lot of the people who are interested, it's almost the perfect opportunity for people who are interested in cooperatives to collaborate with people who are interested in online communities, because both different forums have so much important precedent to provide to those who are now thinking of setting up DAOs. And also determining what DAOs are and I think we've all alluded to that. Like there's no clear definition as to what a DAO is. And there's a lot of different thoughts about what that could be. And that is an incredible ambition I think of some of the take on that task.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
To define out in a way that's meaningful, important to community. And I'm doing a thing right now with the DAO Research Cooperative where we're trying to identify some of the most pressing issues for DAOs. [8:53] Thinking broadly like legal issues, governance issues, treasury management issues and a couple of the initial calls I had that was the first thing that folks brought up. I'm talking to the leaders in the space and it's what is the definition of a DAO, whether it's related to the kinds of systems that a particular organization uses? Or the kinds of obligations it has to its members, or a large variety of things. So when we think about why DAOs are popular? I think in part DAOs are popular because the definition of DAO is so broad that anything is a DAO today, but we might see a fall-off in popularity when we may start defining it more narrowly or at least create subcategories for DAOs.

Richard Brown:
[9:32] I don't want to put you on the spot though, but can get us started what is your definition of DAO? What's your working definition when you're speaking to this people?

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[9:42] That's so tough. I really don't want to dodge the question. I just think that we're at such an early stage of experimentation that we've yet to figure out what a DAO is candidly. And I know that's kind of a shady answer, but I was actually talking to just a VC earlier today and I was asking him about when you're talking to organizations that  you are  looking to invest in and they intend to ultimately become DAOs or like Dexit  how do you think about the way in which they're composing their DAO? How do you think about their timeline for decentralizing into a DAO? And that was really his responses. It was so early here that we actually don't even ask that question, because we just don't think that someone could give us a serious answer.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
And candidly I'm a little bit at the same mind. [10:31] I was talking to Julia Rosenberg from Orca and she's thought like very critically about this sort of stuff. And she was the first one to bring this up to me as a big issue. And from her perspective, and I don't want to misquote her here, but she was talking about uses of particular systems. So when I think about that I would want a forum for proposals, I would want voting mechanisms, I wouldn't just want a telegram group. And so to me it may be very broadly is an organization that allows for decentralized governance, decentralized voting, but I would leave that very broad because I also have kind of a specific view on what members of a DAO should be able to vote for. And I'm not a huge believer in that kind of a one token governance system either. So what we define as DAO broadly today, I may not totally agree with and I imagine that's probably the same for most people on this call.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[11:26]I like that though, because at the moment and we're talking about this process of how you get to a DAO like the Dexit acronym so short for exit to DAO which is a take on Nathan Schneider's exit to community, but they're not decentralized yet in many instantiations. And they're not autonomous. They're kind of organizations and I think a lot of the blockchain community is trying to figure out like, what is an organization? Leighton, you mentioned a suite of DAOs that you're involved in. What's the varying mission, or objective, or goals of these different groups?

**Leighton Cusak:**
Yeah. Yeah.[12:05]  So I think I draw one line very clearly in my DAO involvement. So PoolTogether, I wouldn't really call it a DAO to be honest. Because to me, it's a protocol that has tokenized governance. And some people call this DAOs, but I don't think of those as DAOs like, Compound, Uniswap, even Maker, if you're familiar with these protocols PoolTogether, like I think of it as a protocol with tokenized governance whereas Venture DAO and PleasrDAO they both have DAO in the name. I think of this as DAOs. And the difference in my mind is like Venture DAO, PleasrDAO are a group of people who came together to sort of actively go do new things whereas PoolTogether is like a protocol that was already established, already had hundreds of millions of dollars in it, already was functioning.

**Leighton Cusak:**
And the control was just given of an existing self-perpetuating project to the community. I think that's like a very different thing than, in my experience in PleasrDAO and VentureDAO, is they immediately become very hierarchical, but PoolTogether is not. And it doesn't have to be because there's a very narrow space that we're like making decisions about. Because we're not like debating, completely arbitrary subjects like we are in PleasrDAO and Venture DAO. So that's how I think of them differently which I'd be curious to hear Seth’s input, because I think I would be curious how that maps to maybe like categories in a more academic sense, but that's at least for my personal experience.

**Seth Frey:**
[13:39] Let's see. Well, categories. So I have something a bit akin to folks here this aversion even to defining a DAO I think it's perfectly legitimate and from my perspective, encouraged to end with definitions rather than start with them. To have a word be the name of the thing you're trying to understand. It's consistent with a very iterative, empirical kind of approach that sort of represent you know typical of the kind of experimentation that we see here. And in line with that all governance taxonomies that I encounter in my work I'd say most of my effort goes into trying to break them or push them. And I'm still struggling. As you go across domains from a physical real world let's say, nation state system which is where a lot of our taxonomies come from to a small scale self-governing system. I actually also got my start organizing cooperatives moved into the online space after that, because it's easy to do data science on. I'm originally in the housing co-op sector. So taxonomies is a small scale governance systems. And then moving on to that into the emergent taxonomies of online communities how they understand the differences between themselves. We are still not at a place where there's any kind of unified taxonomy or ontology I could say of the axes along which governance systems vary. And so I'm inclined to everyone's disappointment to come just as much as a watcher and observer than a holder forth.

**Richard Brown:**
[15:27] Have you been tempted to, the co-op spaces has been examined for last four or 500 years and there's a lot of subdivisions, and categorizations, and definitions that have you been tempted to sort of use those as templates to the new DAO ecosystem or do you find that doesn't translate?

**Seth Frey:**
[15:45] Well, you know what it's a really pleasant surprise to find so many people here, coming with some kind of co-op background or interest in and in my understanding, I'm still figuring out the kind of mapping of ideological backgrounds of people in this space so the subset of kind of blockchain applications that they tap into. I do have one kind of litmus test I use for kind of knowing where to start talking to a person which is, okay, visualize Utopia it exists. Let's say Utopia exists and we're in it and it [Utopia] runs out of a building. My question for a lot of people tends to be are there any people in the building? So is governance a system that runs itself or is it inevitably something that we're involved in that we use as a set of tools to govern ourselves, that we're active in the work of governance? And one kind of sense I'm getting already from at least the folks in this small circle is that a lot of you end up more in the idea that it doesn't run itself. So we're active in the extra governance stuff. If anyone wants to not be pigeonholed by me I'd love to.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[16:58] So that's helpful. And to the point about the name referring to autonomy or not. Aaron Wright recently said in a Stanford piece that there are two main types of DAO’s participatory and algorithmic, but really in what we've all described there's both participation or it's not a DAO and there's also algorithms. So there's something happening through Smart Contracts and kind of automation there. So what are your views towards how much or I guess what's being automated? To Seth's point, is it the people being automated out of the system or is it certain levels of functions kind of being automated to give autonomy to the people in the DAO? And then what does that actually mean?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[17:49] I'll do a quick answer on that. So like the idea of social scalability like Nick Szabo’s essay on that from the late 90’s. It was definitely a super influential piece on all my work I've done. And what caught my attention about that piece is that basically his thesis is like smart contracts lower the cost of trust. And so what's being automated is the human trust that's required to broker relationships. When you can lower the costs of trust of entering into new relationships you can have more relationships. And I think the ideal world you can have like an actually like a more flourishing social reality because you're able to be in more relationships with more different people groups because the trust. The trust is what's being automated. So that's my two cents on it.

**Scott Moore:**
[18:42] I definitely think that there's something to that notion in particular. We aren't very good, Seth would know this much better than me. But like Dunbar's number is a really important concept here.  Once, you scale past people it's very difficult to actually have any idea of who those people are like to have really defined relationships with them. And I think what we sort of designed even beyond the area of DAOs like in traditional structures is this idea of like, well, what if we put in structures around voting. Around what it means to participate in the system in a more formalized and less sort of like normative I suppose. And those structures sort of act as scaffolding that allows us to more easily coordinate with like a larger group, because there's processes that we can all agree on even if we don't necessarily know each other and that like is the scaffolding into Leighton's point. It's providing that trust where. And so historically that was very kind of okay. It was just like, Okay. Well, these people that sort of decided on these rules and so I guess that's fine now. And now we can all abide by them. We can trust these people and the tower to decide what these things are. And like in theory I wouldn't say necessarily in practice that's where they are. That's sort of what we're doing and what’s going on here. 

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[19:58] I would say just kind of adding on to that and thinking about the way that different DAOs, I really like the idea of the trust paid by smart contracts allowing for scalability. And even other tooling just the governance mechanisms, even single token like in the Uniswap, or in Compound for instance, the creation of grants programs. So grants programs are obviously, there's a huge part at least in those two organizations. There's a grants committee and they make assessments about projects and then they decide to fund them or to not fund them, but there was a vote done at initial stages as to whether or not those committees should be funded. [20:42] And in looking at MakerDAO too and I know Rich could speak more to this, but as I understand it when MakerDAO decentralized or became a DAO maybe that's the foundation world, there might be other structural pieces I'm not totally familiar with there.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
But some of the functions were allocated to or assigned to new organizations. And so they were just different organizations under the Treasury or the DAO, however you want to state it. And so members of the DAO and this is a specific maker are able to make some decisions about allocating responsibility to other people. And this is potentially where the co-op structure becomes really important. As Rich mentioned, there's four or five years of exploration there. And so we appreciate that cooperatives have members, but the members don't make every single decision. They assign decisions to management. And so in that same way we're seeing assignment of different responsibilities. Sometimes organizations and at other times to potentially individuals and DAOs.

**Scott Moore:**
Rich?

**Richard Brown:**
[21:36] So it relates to something that Leighton was talking about earlier, where some DAOs or protocol management DAOs. You've largely governance mechanisms around binary decision trees basically. So we vote for this, we vote for that. Then there's engagements or creative and the list goes on and on. From the co-op model that you're kind of decentralizing or taking a committee model to a business unit. And so that's one of the ways that these more complicated are to a business organization. That's why some of these more complicated organizations are able to maintain themselves with more egalitarian decision making processes, which in my mind kind of raises the question. And you triggered me with the maker question, because as an organization becomes more and more complex and all of its decision making responsibilities get spun out to the community, is there an upper limit on the complexity of a DAO? Is it possible to scale or are you sort of three steps past the protocol management level? Then maybe it's time to look at a firm instead or does this group believe that DAOS can scale?

**Seth Frey:**
[22:43] That's interesting. Because for me, that brings up a little bit of attention I was between where Rich is and where Leighton, Scott and Connor are. For, among Leighton, Scott and Connor sort of seemed like there's an understanding that trust needs to be scalable, and now its scalable. But a little bit where Rich is coming from is well, centralization is a great way to scale things. And because society has a history of centralization scale hasn't really been the problem. We have scalable trust. There's centrally managed reputation systems, there's centrally managed currencies and essentially kind of architected engineered market economies. So I'm curious is there a conflict here? Is there a proposal that a decentralized scheme is ultimately more scalable than centralized scheme? Are we challenging the scalability of centralized schemes, or as Rich as kind of possibly indicating is the goal to get these decentralized schemes as scalable as centralized schemes? And on top of that expressing all the other benefits of decentralization?

**Richard Brown:**
[23:52] Well, I was kind of hoping that Scott would jump in because if I look at my crystal ball Gitcoin is heading down sort of the same road. So these are the challenges staring him directly in the face. Yeah. Do you have something to say Scott?

**Scott Moore:**
[24:02] Yeah. I think that's a fair assessment. My view would be that you have easy access to scale when you're centralized. It's very easy to scale, but it's simultaneously much more fragile than if you had a decentralized system in the sense that you don't actually have any kind of redundancy against corruption basically. If like that centralized authority starts acting in some way that's incorrect, or against the norms, or is illegitimate, or anything like that. You run into an immediate collapse of like that system, or maybe not always immediate, an eventual slow decline of that system. That's what you see in every country where there's been a government that's been inactive, it's suddenly doesn't really deal with the people or have like any really connections to little people.

**Scott Moore:**
And those sorts of situations tend to be much more damaging than if you had a system that was slightly less scalable, but kind of a bit more robust. And a bit more functionally kind of accountable I suppose. So I think there's tradeoffs in those models between how much executive function do you have and how much of the legislative function do you have? And so forth. But I think one of the things we've learned from, and the reason that I think democracies sort of are prominent sort of examples of governance that we have today is not because they're perfect options. It's because they're kind of a bad option. And they kind of aren't great, but they kind of work. And we don't have a better in my mind option at the moment.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[25:40] Scott mentioned something which triggered something for me which is also in thinking about centralized systems if you could develop your partially centralized systems that have some level of checks and balances. We think about government and there are three different branches of government. And the courts, watch Congress, and the President watches the court executive, judicial, and congressional is the third. But can we do something similar with DAOs and the corporation similar thing board members and then executives. So some level of oversight and then shareholders as well have certain rights too. This is something that Jesse Walden and I  wrote about it in part was when we're thinking about completely, for instance, maybe one extreme being token holders making every decision about how a Treasury is used.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
Instead of having a treasury management committee which specializes in thinking really critically about every decision made. Should we diversify and invest in a certain amount of stable coins and invest in a certain amount of tokens from other protocols, etc? You have the entire community making decisions and so we can easily say, okay. That's not incredibly scalable. And then when we think about other functions to like, legal, for instance. If at some point you need to think about, "Okay. We're diversifying our Treasury. What are the tax consequences of doing that? Who is the counterparty who's going to pay the IRS because they're going to be coming for us eventually?" If you have a decentralized community who is getting the memo from the lawyer, because all of a sudden it's no longer privileged or confidential. It could be used as evidence against you. So there are just a number of different ways that it can be very problematic to be fully decentralized in the way that the world works today. So I think it'd be hard to say maximally efficient. Yeah.

**Richard Brown:**
Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, deal flow, any anything that requires some discretion is going to be tough in a DAO model I believe. 

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[27:31] So it's interesting to think about some of those kind of values based or kind of ideological approaches to governance, but we've got some experts here in terms of actual experience of DAOing and trying to do decentralized governance, what are some of the challenges or strengths that are emerging in your personal experiences?

**Scott Moore:**
[27:54] To jump in again, but one thing that actually really came up from that last comment was, it's funny because we did run into a very similar example of that problem with the whole, there was this whole Akita situation that's emerged in which it for those that are familiar there's kind of this history of people getting random tokens to Vitalik [Buterin]. Generally, it's not very favorable for Vitalik  because he just gets these random tokens. And then he's kind of like promoted as part of these schemes and because it's kind of an issue. In the Akita situation it was kind of interesting because these original founders of this token dropped these. And then they had exits at some point. So these other folks kind of like started rallying you got to a point where during sort of the last peak of the market there were just like almost 100,000 people that were like part of this DAO community. And the reason I'm bringing this up is because eventually Vitalik gave a bunch of these tokens to things like COVID India relief to a lot of longevity related organizations and to us to Gitcoin.

**Scott Moore:**
[29:00] We got 50% of the supply of this Akita token. And it was entirely public in terms of how the community was deciding what to do with these tokens. And they originally just sort of said, "Well, we'll sell these. Done with it." And what they didn't realize is like that decision was being made in an adversarial environment where everyone else was able to see that information. And so what that meant is that the Akita community responded. There was a kind of prisoner's dilemma of sorts that emerge. We had to kind of like, at the community of the DAO had to figure out basically what does it mean to go from like a defect effect sort of state to a cooperative state. And eventually that happened which was pretty cool to see in practice, but having these sort of executive committees in place would have probably been preferable for that kind of decision. And so that's actually been something that's been formatted into the data structure now with these ideas of work streams. And kind of these executive bodies that can make particular decisions while still being accountable to the overall organization.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[30:03] For context you had, Gitcoin, had been a DAO for a number of weeks when this vote was going on. And what was that treasury worth? What was the value of the Akita doge tokens?

**Scott Moore:**
[30:15] Well, that's a tricky part because if people are saying like 500 million, but it was not worth that much. Because really the spot price is this sort of thing. There's not a sense of liquidity. Liquidity is very low. Maybe in the range of five million to 10 million, but to your point so a lot of money for a DAO. It’s just like I'm going to do this how are we supposed to manage this treasury? What are we doing? And so it was certainly like, I was actually surprised that it even got to a point where it was something meaningful done with those given that it was like a two week thing. None of these  stewards see the sort of representative democracy system that was put in place based on this retroactive distribution. And eventually the stewards sort of roughly knew of each other through that process, but didn't really know much about each other coordinated on this, which is kind of wild to see. It's a very good case where executive functions.

**Richard Brown:**
[31:06] Is there maybe a tradeoff here? In traditional business these are decisions that have come home in the boardroom, nobody ever hears about it on the assembly line, but in the DAO space have we replaced lobbying, and public appeals, and forum threads for committee decision or decision is that, because I followed the threads. They were enormously entertaining from my perspective, sorry Scott, when it was happening it's all play out in public.

**Scott Moore:**
[31:33] Yes. I'll let Leighton jump in. I saw him stand up to that, but I would just say I definitely there's a balance between executive function and legislative function. The question of what that proper balance is? Which is the hard question, but certainly go on.

**Leighton Cusak:**
[31:50] I wasn't actually trying to nod my head because doing so, but I think I was smiling because Rich, I was honing in on what you just said was that DAO still have a lot of back channels. There still is like a lot of like, before I propose this I'm going to ask this person or like, I'm going to tell this person. So that's sort of what I was thinking about Rich.

**Richard Brown:**
[32:15] Well, I don't want to go down this road too far, because there's a lot of interesting things to talk about. But that was very early on in the Maker development. It became apparent to us on the inside that at some point in the future DAO lobbyists are going to be a thing. And I think that the ecosystem is kind of waking up to this. And I don't think that we're that far away from literal lobbyists like agencies whose job it is to get votes put through in various organizations because it's public opinion now. And that's directly responsible. It's almost what, hesitant to say it's more effective than in traditional democracies, but we see direct financial incentives for votes to occur. And that's a very motivating force. And so lobbying I think is underappreciated how important that is in our space right now.

**Seth Frey:**
[33:03] At this kind of level of abstraction at this kind of strange mapping the idea of lobbyists isn't going to be super different from the idea of a political party. Maybe in this metaphor a party is just a lobby where the participants are also lobbyists. And so the literature and political science talks about how political parties exists to kind of coordinate units at different levels. And of course, there's skeptics about political parties, but this is probably the large literature that's quite sort of optimistic about the importance of political parties as another kind of agent in a polycentric governance system doing a lot of coordination work and lining up work as well as, in the case of nation states like a talent finding and elevating kind of role.

**Richard Brown:**
[33:58] You've seen some engaged participants Leighton in your ecosystem as well with governance token allocations, with various pools as well, did you see any sign of lobbying?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[34:12] I don't think we've seen, no, I don't think we've seen it yet. Not in any formalized way. No, but one thing…

**Kelsie Nabben:**
You mentioned hierarchy  before too if you could talk to that as well?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[34:23] Yeah. Yeah. I think I have like an unspoken idea that DAO are not hierarchical or they shouldn't be. I don't know who would agree with that or not, but yeah. My finding has been that in DAOs that are not associated with protocols they become very hierarchical very fast, because it's just, I don't think we have a way. I haven't experienced a way to organize people and get stuff done without hierarchy. And maybe that's just my capitalist brainwashing, but I haven't seen it yet. So, um, yeah. The only other comment I was going to make too is, I think an interesting dynamic I've seen in DAO’s is that almost no one votes against anything. It's very rare to have controversial votes. And so it creates this weird bias where sort of whoever, I think Richard started at this a little bit there's definitely a risk factor of the people who are just paying attention can sort of push through whatever they want. Because 99% of people aren't paying attention, or maybe 10% of people are paying attention. To that 10% they just don't want to be negative, they don't want to vote against something. So we'll have a good debate in the forums, but when it actually comes to voting generally speaking it's like 99% to 1%.

**Seth Frey:**
[35:50] This sort of gets a subtle thing about governance and the rules that is going, in my imagination, is going to represent kind of design challenges. Especially from the governance space we think that rules are really important. We think of rules as the figure against the ground of possible action, especially if you have a very mechanism kind of focus your governance then we define behavior in the system by defining rules. The funny thing happened to some colleagues of mine who were doing, actually ABM, agent based modeling of governance systems. And what they found was the divine sort of virtual resource, and virtual behavior, and virtual incentives, and then you find the rules.

**Seth Frey:**
What they found is that rules got triggered actually very rarely. That rules are just there to manage edge cases. Rules tend to be their rule violation. And policy subtleties tend to be there for the weird things that happen. For the most part the system kind of runs itself, people do their things under an overall framework of, but the actual need for conflict resolution mechanisms, for example, is pretty rare. And I guess that's encouraging from the perspective of a community that's skeptical about the importance or the need for rules in the hierarchy that wants to offer a lot of freedom to a lot of people under a trusting environment. Although it's probably going to be challenging from a design perspective, because it's going to reduce the rate at which you get signal about your governance design.

**Leighton Cusak:**
[37:28] Yeah. Yeah. It seems like the mechanism for resolving conflicts in DAO’s is exiting. I think that's like all I've seen so far. It's like whoever ends up with the disagreement leaves.

**Richard Brown:**
[37:43] Failure in yourself though, right? That's the last thing you want, isn't it?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[37:48] I'm not saying what it should be, but I'm saying I feel like that's the reality. It’s the people who wanted like, that's like Ethereum Classic and Ethereum you know, and BCH and like Bitcoin and it's exiting and forking. 

**Richard Brown:**
[38:06] Okay. So you mean capital EX as opposed to just wandering away from the table? So wandering away from your ecosystem would be bad?

**Scott Moore:**
[38:14] To be sure, there is like a lack of participation which is a huge problem in these systems in a lot of cases. I actually would note  like so far we've had three contentious votes of like six total votes or so. Which is I guess a good sign, but also is stressful. But I do think the lack of participation problem is a greater problem than is your point. Like the Moloch DAO rage quit model is even more worrying if you can just like, people will just go off and create their own splinters, and splinters, and splinters. So I think it's very important to like, I guess, like the corollary of that is like think through rules carefully and think through how you ensure participation carefully. You'll get the outcomes you design the incentives for I guess in some fashion.

**Richard Brown:**
[39:04] Kelsie, I want to apologize. I know that you have an agenda, but I kind of can't resist because this was a huge, huge challenge at Maker. And I would love to hear what Scott and Leighton have to say about this. And engagement is basically what it's all about. If you're handing the range of your protocol, a protocol can be viewed as a computer program. And if you're giving the configuration to a group of individuals, strangers and expecting them to maintain this protocol it has value at risk. How do you ensure participation? How do you get them coming back week after week making informed decisions? Leighton do you want to kick us off?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[39:41] Well, I'll first say we went into our Dexit  with I was way too idealistic about this. So our theory was like, okay, we're going to give away a ton of the Pool tokens that govern the system. We gave more to our community. We gave 15% to our early community. And we gave like 7% to the people who had invested in the company PoolTogether. So we gave away like way more to the community. And then we also set the threshold super low for how many tokens you had to have to vote, and to create proposals? The thesis was like people are going to be excited, they're going to want to participate because it's super low, they have tons of tokens. And this is going to really kickstart community. And that just didn't happen at all.

**Leighton Cusak:**
So that's not an answer to your question Rich, but it’s an articulation of the problem of how I've experienced a problem. Yeah. So what I have found though is since we did that over time though, a real organic community has emerged. And I don't know how we keep them around. I think they just like it. I think they I think it's maybe cultural then is the answer. We start to sort of become friends. And it becomes yeah. It becomes sort of cultural. And it's like a lot of people who are at work, but they're on discord all day with us hanging out and we're all chatting about the same stuff. And we have calls every single Friday. So we do have rituals. Like every Friday we have our calls. You know that's probably another answer. So maybe it's ultimately like the culture at least in my lived experience. It's been like the culture and the community that's kept people engaged and coming back and like that's our cadre of people who really make all the decisions and for the governance.

**Scott Moore:**
[41:29] One of the things that Ruth Catlow from Furtherfield kind of mentions is like we need to be building like cultures before we open structures. And I think that's like very true with DAOs like, if it goes back to precision versus automation. We need you to think about like, what are people participating for? What is the reason they're part of this community? And I actually think in general like having that mission is like step one. And we've been lucky with like this republican admission. It's gotten enough people into that state where they're willing to put time into governance. But I think long term there needs to be a sort of model for, I might be a hot take a bit, but I think it's like need to have incentivize participation in these processes at some point.

**Scott Moore:**
And I think the reason for that it's the same reason that finding an open source software. Like yes. You want the people who are intrinsically motivated to do the work and to be part of the open source software community, but also the people who really want to do work and like cancel the open source software community are mostly constrained by extrinsic motivation factors like money, if you don't have like the capital to participate in the system. So I think that's going to be one really important piece to kind of like push for governance to the next level. But I think without that mission component, and without that culture component you won't like incentives along.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[42:56] That's really interesting because what was mentioned before as well as needing to professionalize some of the functions of DAOs such as treasury management. You might want people that have experience in that to be responsible for that part of the DAO. We've kind of talked about these Dexit models where people have slowly or are in sort of transition towards more decentralization. Connor, are you aware of kind of DAO first models, which is a phrase coined by Kane Warwick from Synthetix about what people have tried to set the rules in advance and how that has gone for participation? Because I guess those are the ones that usually incentivize with salaries or bounties kind of straight up?

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[43:45] Interesting. Actually, I'm not super familiar with the outcome for the DAO first models. I've worked with a lot of organizations that have gone foundation first thinking about DAOs. And in my experience that's absolutely how I would do it if I were to launch a DAO, oh, sorry. If I were to launch a protocol. And the reason being of course that there's so much to work through after the initial launch. And I've probably shown my bias a little bit. I think that there needs to be some level of, I don't know, I don't really want to call it some level of centralization, but some level of shooting responsibilities to certain groups. And also problem solving quickly particularly immediately after launch when you can run into a lot of problems.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
I would love to know more about organizations that went DAO first and then see how they do in the long term. A lot the same incentives are there I know for of course, as Leighton mentioned too that he gave more than 15% of tokens away, and I think we pulled together. And a lot of organizations do the same thing. Part of it is like airdrop strategy is really key when you're thinking about that. So how do you do your airdrop, who are the people that, even identifying individuals that you're going to airdrop to is really important thinking about their vesting schedule. Thinking about how they're going to be involved. I think what Scott flagged too around requiring participation or incentivizing participation might be a really good idea.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[4515] As of now a lot of different DAOs those that start as foundations have moved as even just distribute tokens based on maybe individuals who they know or who have maybe like Uniswap use their platform before, but or who were part of their email listserv candidly. And it would be so much more impactful if you were able to encourage those folks to become involved in the community somehow so you could potentially get them sticking to it, but to your initial question maybe someone else is better to answer that as to how it's gone for those DAOs that have gone DAO first, but I would generally I would advise against it. Having seen how many operational issues you run into.

**Scott Moore:**
[45:59] So I think that model works really well for small DAOs. And actually Leighton I’d love your  kind of thoughts on PleasrDAO in this way. Because I think that is a very good example of a DAO first sort of model that works. At least from what I'm seeing is a member of PleasrDAO, it's works quite well. And I think that the other one that I referenced which almost is become famous, or infamous and evaluated in spaces like Metacartel. Metacartel was kind of like an offshoot of Moloch DAO that Peter Pan started because, actually, I think because his model failed basically. And it ended up being the start of a huge journey which has launched so many projects in the space at this point. And I think it works. Again, going back to the culture point, because he built in from there. Like start kind of just like, almost just collaborative, positive vibe culture. I don't know how to describe it even, it was just like people wanted to be there. It was fun. There wasn't a lot at stake really with it. Especially when it was first starting. And so it was just kind of, yeah. Let's go and try and build these systems together, survive through the sort of part of the bear market when no one really was interested in systems and web three, they were just like, "We're already here might as well  just hang out."

**Scott Moore:**
[47:20] And they actually, we're a lot of the foundational part of the culture in that era of the ecosystem. I guess that's shows that the power of that one particular concept of DAOs and I think that the reason that was able to kind of work is the same reason that models and Web 2 like on deck or what we're doing in Gitcoinand with Kernel how those work. Which is like when you create cohorts or base systems where people can organically even kind of how the stand up this moments. It’s like why San Francisco works. It's a city I would even say. It’s like when you can create these spaces and get really cool people together to have the same goals, the same ideas, the same culture then you get a lot of really cool results. Now there's problems with that model too, which is how do you scale that? And I think the Metacartel example it when it got to a certain size, it kept fragmented with other smaller DAOs that had their own sort of side but really rules. And I think that's maybe one thing to note historically, but in general those cohort based systems seemed very powerful and small scale.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[48:34] So speaking of creativity, what are some of the areas that you guys are seeing being innovated in DAOs? Is it around governance? Is it around specific mechanisms? Is it voting or is it much, much broader?

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[48:58] This thing is very based on this started off as something that is incredibly basic, but in looking at proposals made and temperature checks. Almost the how democratic it is? Like for a lot of snapshots it's some random person who potentially has no tokens and maybe admits they have no tokens followed by the chief operating officer of the company, followed by someone, like there's no hierarchy or no real substantial hierarchy in a lot of these forums which is pretty amazing. So anyone can really have their say. So if you want to make your name in DAO’s you can just participate in these protocols which is pretty amazing. It's almost like having access to the CEO of the company at an annual meeting of shareholders. And having the same level access as that CEO has to communicate with participants in their organization. So I think that's something that's pretty amazing. And we're seeing play out live. And I think that might be something that changes over time too.

**Scott Moore:**
[50:03] I can definitely jump in, but I'd be very curious to get Seth's thoughts on this too, just in terms of like, we spent a lot of time thinking about these different governance models and like, even beyond this space and for those ones that we haven't thought of, but the two that come to mind for me in terms of just like, and this is more aspirational in terms of things I would like to see which are things that we're working on the Gitcoin side. By wanting obviously the quadratic building, like having a sort of more distributed form of voting leading, rather than simply token based voting which is good, but can be captured. In our case we've been lucky that most of the distribution that's available to people has been given to people who had worked in like funded grants, or creative grants, or compare the platform in other ways for three or more years.

**Scott Moore:**
And so generally speaking there are people that actually also have a history not just in Gitcoin, but in the Ethereum ecosystem at large which gives them a level of like buying to not defect. And do things that would hurt governance. But I think that like especially for systems that don't have that check in place and as in our system grows having people come in having something like the quadratic voting system would  be really good. And the other one would be community building, which I think is really cool like giving people the ability to have higher stake if you're walking to tokens for longer and showcasing to the overall system, which I know RMIT has done some really good work on past, but Seth what else have you got?

**Seth Frey:**
[51:33] Well, for the most part I'm going to probably pass off to someone like Leighton when it comes to using today's toolbox and mechanisms to come up with a creative solution to a problem that a group of people have. Like on the ground what's going on now? Overall, in a lot of ways I see the space a little bit recapitulating kind of a history of organization theory, organization theory started off. Here are structures and here's why structure matters. And then you can very succinctly wrap up the whole history of the field by ending up at culture and culture matters.

**Seth Frey:**
[52:11] Now, we've seen in this conversation already, hey, soft power matters. Hey, back channels matter. Hey, culture matters. Hey, leadership matters. And none of that human trust matters essentially what that reduces to so. So, dominating this conversation have been the thing that mechanism can't do. What's going to happen? We're going to do absolutely everything with mechanism we can. Maybe I'm being too pessimistic, but there's a fair chance all this stuff that was hard in organizations due to that soft stuff is just going to be hard in DAO’s too. So I'm not super convinced that, I want to skip to that. I want to skip to the soft stuff to culture to the science of that. So I still have to wait to be convinced that this is a space for that. Now, it will be a space for that in the sense that I get thousands and thousands of organizations that accidentally got cultured despite their mechanisms.

**Seth Frey:**
And I get to see how that played out because so much of exchange is public and there's so many examples that compare across, but that'll be entirely at your expense.

**Leighton Cusak:**
[53:24] One thing I will throw out. Connor, you touched on this like DAOs are very cool. And I think we probably forget how cool they are. I remember probably my first experience with the DAO really was a MakerDAO governance call that Rich was hosting. And this is like three years ago. It was like they would always tweeted out like starting in five minutes. Here's like Google meet link. And I just joined it. And it's basically you're dropping into a boardroom. And you're just there all of a sudden. It's like everything's open and public. I was like, "Whoa, this is insane. This is so cool." And I think that we take a lot of stuff for granted, but Connor you touched on that too, you have the project founder. And then you also have smart kitty cat 666 or whatever the names are. And they're debating each other. Anyways, Kelsie, that's sort of trying to get back to your question, but that's not a new thing. But I do think maybe that's an old thing that we can forget is new to most people.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[54:31] I think we've just touched the surface of a lot of the kind of theory that's going on as well as the mechanisms, and the challenges and ways to respond to those. I want to come back to this point about autonomy or autonomous organizations, because it's something that we've barely spoken about, but it's in the title. So perhaps framed around a future and the directions that DAOs are heading, what kinds of features do you think that DAOs create?

**Leighton Cusak:**
I'll go real quick, even though I just talked.  I think that I just start, but my thesis is it's up to us. And I think there is a very dystopian like hyper individualistic way that autonomous systems create enable hyper individualism. But I also think autonomous systems potentially enable a lot more community that goes back to that scalability idea. We could have more relationships because the foundation's autonomous. And I think whether or not we're heading towards like the Bitcoin, hyper individualistic. I'm a Bitcoin and I live in a cabin in the woods. I don't need anyone. Or are we heading towards a new era of social collaboration I think it's really up to what we build and how we build it.

**Scott Moore:**
[55:53] Yeah. One thing I would maybe note is I actually think still that while there will be things in DAOs that are automated, we will still going back to the earlier points rely on participation, rely on people. People are at the heart of these organizations. They're at the heart of any organization really, fundamentally. And I don't think we can fully extract it away, but I think that we can start extracting away some of the things that would otherwise distract us from the kinds of coordination that actually matter within the context of a certain goal we're trying to achieve. So for us, our goal is really to find ways to fund people with public goods. Like we don't necessarily need to be really focused in on like, to Rich's point to treasury management or that can be delegated to an executive community obviously that  matters.

**Scott Moore:**
It's critical to the ability to fund these things, but the question is that we actually want to be addressing are probably more focusing on what kinds of things are considered public goods in the first place? What kinds of things are good? What are these general ideas of the future we want to see? And in terms of just structure as the last one I think the way I'd like to see DAOs kind of emerge or progress is in the context of the Rochdale Principles. I'm mispronouncing that terribly, but the idea of kind of voluntary cooperativism think it's very, very relevant. And you touched on it a number of times here, but I think that unless we get that right, unless we can kind of embody those principles I think in a worse state we run the risk of kind of having a lot of these DAOs that aren't really, or maybe leading us to a more uncertain future. And part of the reason that I started thinking more about that actually is just related to a piece by the Gnosis Guild on Mirror I really highly recommend people check out on a prehistory of DAOs or just shout out to that piece the final note.

**Seth Frey:**
[57:59] Well, the shout out to Rochdale Principles is very exciting and promising. I think it shows a lot of the intentions, at least the people in this room, all of whom have named co-ops in one way or another. I think where I come out it's not a question of can DAOs enable, or embody those principles, or accelerate how we represent them? It's kind of do it at a faster rate that enables us to just do more of what we already are doing or can allow us to specify as it allows other people to do more destructive or cynical things. And yeah. I can say I'm watching eagerly.

**Richard Brown:**
[58:42] My last add in this comes full circle is I've spoken with folks who are not down with each of the words in decentralized autonomous organization. Lawyers who are really opposed to organizations, many people who question whether any of these are autonomous fully depending on what you define as a DAO. And then also the decentralized piece like are so many of these treasuries that people call DAO’s are pretty little DAO’s actually decentralized. So just to bring it back to almost our first question of definition, this is a big open question. And we're still so early in exploration phase, but something to aspire to like a decentralized autonomous organization sounds quite nice. So I'm happy to keep using the term.

**Richard Brown:**
[59:28] Yeah. And I think that maybe I can put a bow on this, because to sort of follow on to everything that has already been said previously is from my perspective the crypto space is inspiring, and endearing, and frequently frustrating, reinvention of things that we already have. But with the delightful improvements here and there and a little crypto anarchic spins on top of these things, but it's our discovery and a rediscovery. And if I had to put money on it I think that what we're going to see over the next few years are DAOs, discovering co-ops. And then tokenizing, and codifying, and writing smart contracts around co-op models that are fairly well established. I think it'll take us a bit to get there. Because when I started out at Maker I said, "Oh, wow. This is amazing guys. So you guys have a co-op with a token. This is incredible. What's a co-op? All right." Take a while I guess. I think that we're approaching models that need to align with how people want to work and how they want to coordinate? And I think that we have a long history of that co-op space. I think that's where we're going to end up. It's just a matter of picking the tools and the culture that we're going to overlay on top of this things.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
[1:00:42] That's really interesting and I think there's a wealth of both research experience through this. The attendees of this call today being folded into the space as well as on the ground practical experience. Where can people find you and participate in the DAOs that you're connected with, a couple of seconds each as we go around the room, Leighton?

**Leighton Cusak:**
[1:01:07] For PoolTogether Discord, we mostly live on Discord. So go to our PoolTogether join the Discord and just hop in and say hi. And we'll get someone to say hi to you.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Connor?

**Connor Spelliscy:**
[1:01:17] Best way to reach me and keep up to date on what we're doing in our research cooperatives just to find me on Twitter with my last name, which is pretty rare. So you'll likely find me.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Spelliscy? Connor Spelliscy.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
Yeah. About that? Yeah, approximately.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Okay. Seth?

**Seth Frey:**
[1:01:33] I just put my email as my name. And you can find me as infascination as in to infascinate someone that's both Twitter and my website.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Awesome. And you mentioned Metagov as well which I anticipated-

**Seth Frey:**
[1:01:47] That’s right. metagov.org.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Yeah. Highly recommended.

**Seth Frey:**
Good to have you. And yeah. And anyone eager about governance experimentation, writ large online, it's a great community.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
Scott?

**Scott Moore:**
[1:02:04] The best place for governance we've got is gov.gitcoin.co the Discord is just Discord.gg/Gitcoin. And my Twitter is just not something real. So as you can probably see in the little box below.

**Kelsie Nabben:**
And Rich for people that want to follow along with SCRF, or Smart Contract Research Forum?

**Richard Brown:**
I shall let Eugene pick that one up. So if they want to find me I'll be in our chat and in our discord, but Eugene has some information I think about how to follow on this conversation.

**Eugene Leventhal:**
[1:02:40] Yeah. I just wanted to thank Kelsie, to thank all of our participants who really appreciate you taking the time today to share your work and your thoughts. For anyone who does want to continue the conversation please feel free to check out smartcontractresearch.org. We're going to have a dedicated posts to this specific panel as for all five of the panels that were moderating there. And each one of those posts will include more information on the work of all of the panelists and our moderator. How to get in touch with them and their projects. So if you didn't happen to write things down in time as they were listing we'll make sure it's all up on the forum posts. And we'll also have some more information on the topic as a whole. And we really are looking forward to keeping the dialogue going around. These kinds of governance questions that are very clearly complicated and have a lot of experimentation results to learn from. So we're definitely looking forward to keeping the momentum on there. And yeah. Just thanks again and we hope you have a chance to enjoy the rest of the summit.
**Richard Brown:**
Thank you everybody.

**Leighton Cusak:**
Thank you, Kelsie.

**Scott Moore:**
Thanks everyone.

**Seth Frey:**
Thanks so much.

**Connor Spelliscy:**
That's a lot of fun.
