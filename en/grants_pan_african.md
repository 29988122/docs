# Pan-African Micro-Grant Program

## Description

From early adoption of solar power to mobile phone usage and mobile payments, Africa has a long history of technological “leapfrogging.” The Continent has proven time and again that it is capable of radical technical innovation and developing nations in the region are perfectly positioned to leapfrog the legacy financial system through the widespread adoption of blockchain. 

Yet, these developments remain largely unknown outside of Africa.

By creating a program that provides micro-grants to students and alumni of African universities, the [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) hopes to publish a steady stream of public and open African-focused research that may not be available to the broader crypto community. 

This project will also allow SCRF to surface talent we can add to the core team. Successful grantees may be asked to submit additional grant applications and may be offered longer-term engagements with SCRF.

## What we are looking for

The Pan African Grants program is the first of SCRF’s regional grants efforts, focusing initially on Western Africa. The program’s goal is to extend micro-grants to academics and researchers to write [Research Summaries](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary) of African academic papers or regional blockchain case studies.

SCRF content is designed to surface cutting-edge research and presents it more succinctly than what can be found in the original publications. For this grants program, we are also particularly interested in examinations of Use Cases that provide the wider ecosystem with insight into the successes *and* failures of blockchain projects in the region. 

Given the potential of blockchain and adjacent technologies, we seek to create as many opportunities to engage researchers as we can. Literature Reviews, Related Works, and Theses can take considerable time and effort for researchers and post-docs exploring this space. SCRF can be the place where long-term discussions can be had regarding their work, and researchers can be compensated for their time creating Research Summaries, which can be shared with the ecosystem.

In addition to supporting researchers through grants, we’re also looking for moderators, editors, project managers, social media experts, among other roles. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested. 

## Compensation

Grant recipients will receive USD 300 to write a single Research Summary or Use Case.

We pay in cryptocurrency. For longer commitments, alternative arrangements can be made.

If you cannot accept direct payments because of your university or funding agency, we can discuss alternative options. This could include:

* funding a project
* conference travel
* charitable donations to an endowment in lieu
* credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc
* supporting a blockchain-related organization or event of your choice

## How we Communicate

**Chat:** We use our [#general chat](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) for discussions about content, blockchain-related events, coordination, and project planning.

**Project Management:** All the work that SCRF produces is created collaboratively in a [public document pipeline](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5). Please feel free to look around.

**Live meetings:** We have several weekly meetings for pitching ideas, status updates, projects and processes, and planning forum engagement.

## How to apply

If you are an undergrad or graduate student with interest and insights into blockchain technologies and are comfortable with writing Research Summaries or Use Case examinations, we would like to hear from you. Academics, researchers, or industry participants are also welcome to apply. 

Interested applicants should fill out the [following application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewBrQY-0X2Iawgyvq4pgPhGgiCv2ZnoKBSKfmTljSV3KeaLg/viewform). 

## Expectations 

All grant recipients will be expected to complete a Research Summary or Use Case examination within four weeks. During those four weeks, grant recipients are expected to attend a number of check-in meetings.

The research will go through peer review before publication to ensure the highest academic and intellectual rigor level.

## What is SCRF?

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) is where academics, researchers, and industry leaders from all over the world come together to discuss research, solicit thoughtful peer review, and find new projects on which to collaborate.

Please feel free to come and introduce yourself in our [chat](https://discord.gg/7WPRb8FHvd). Another great way to introduce yourself to us is to find a thread on the [SCRF website](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) and add a well-reseasoned or insightful comment to one of the discussions.

If you would like to get some deeper insight into how we do work and what we have on the go, you can also have a look at our [public board](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5).
