# SCRF: Template - Mini-Post

Description: The research or engagement teams can resurface older content by soliciting a long-form comment or short-form discussion post from the research team.

There are three main ways in which these long-form comments can be used to create new content out of older existing content:

- A combination of concepts or models presented in distinct posts that can be compared or contrasted
- An update or new development that expands upon the body of work that was laid down in a previous post
- A new take or spin that can be phrased as a question that prompts the rethinking of a previous discussion post or research summary.
