# SCRF: Template - Mini-Post

Description: The research or engagement teams can revive older content by soliciting a new (but old) content type from the research team: a long-form comment or short-form discussion post. 

There are three main ways in which a long-form comment can be used to create new content out of older existing content:

1. A combination of two concepts or models presented in distinct posts that can be compared or contrasted
1. An update or new development that furthers the body of work that was laid down in a previous post
1. A new take or spin that can be phrased as a question that prompts the rethinking of a previously framed discussion post or research summary.
