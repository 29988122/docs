# SCRF Reading Group

## What is SCRF?

The Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF) serves as an open, agnostic bridge between academia and industry. Supported by an international community dedicated to advancing actionable blockchain research, our mission is to surface challenging problems in the space and present them to an active community of academics, researchers, and developers. It is the ecosystemâ€™s source for problems to solve, and to find the people, projects, and tools to solve them. Learn [more about SCRF here](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs).

## About the Reading Group

The SCRF Reading Group is an opportunity for community members to focus their attention on a singular notable work and to discuss that work in-depth. The focus will be on long-form works about blockchain technologies, their impact, and implementations. This reading group helps SCRF develop as a thoughtful community of thinkers seeking to apply knowledge to solve the immediate questions of the crypto ecosystem. It is also a good entry point for new members of SCRF as they seek to develop their analytical skills as future SCRF researchers.

The reading group selections are chosen by the SCRF community in our [chat](https://discord.gg/QKktHJU9), so make sure to inquire about participation there. Discussion about the selected readings happens on the [Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org). Once the reading group has finished their discussion, one or more members can summarize the work and publish it on the forum as either a [Research Summary or Discussion post](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs#content-templates).
