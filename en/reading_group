# SCRF Reading Group

## Description

The SCRF reading group creates an opportunity for community members to focus their attention on a singular work and discuss that work in-depth. The overall focus of the reading group is on long-form works about blockchain technologies, impacts, and implementations. This reading group helps SCRF develop as a thoughtful community of thinkers seeking to apply knowledge to solve the immediate questions of the crypto ecosystem. This is also a good entry point for members of SCRF as they seek to develop their analysis skills and develop as future SCRF researchers. 

The reading group selections are chosen by the SCRF community in the [chat](https://discord.gg/QKktHJU9), so make sure to inquire about participation in the reading group there. Discussion about the selected readings happens on the [Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org). Once the reading group has finished their discussion, one or more members can summarize the work and publish it on the forum as either a [Research Summary or Discussion post](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs#content-templates).


## How To Join

You can join a reading group at any point in the process, but each reading group will have the following stages:



1. The reading group is announced in chat and the forum.
2. Readings are solicited from the community in chat.
3. The reading is selected and a schedule for discussion is discussed in chat.
4. The reading group questions and comments are posted to the reading group forum thread.
5. A final announcement post in the forum thread indicates that the reading group is done with their active discussion.
