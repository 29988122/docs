# SCRF: Impact Award

## Description

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF)'s monthly Impact Award honors researchers whose work represents exceptional achievement, particularly in an underappreciated or novel area of blockchain research. It's our way of saying "thank you" once a month to researchers who are contributing valuable work to the ecosystem.

## What we are looking for

To be considered for an SCRF Impact Award, the researcher's work must have already been covered in [Research Pulse](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/research-pulse), a [Research Summary](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary), or showcased in some other interaction on our forum. 

## Disbursements

Award recipients will receive a USD 1,000 allocation in recognition of their contributions. We issue funds in cryptocurrency.

If you cannot accept funds directly, we can discuss alternative options. This could include:

- funding a project
- conference travel
- charitable donations to an endowment in lieu
- credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc.
- supporting a blockchain-related organization or event of your choice

## Award Winners 

Impact Award grants are announced on our [forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/scrf-impact-award/581).

## How we Communicate

**Chat:** We use our [#general chat](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) to discuss new content, blockchain-related events, coordination, and project planning.

**Project Management:** All the work that SCRF produces is created collaboratively in a [public document pipeline](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5). Please feel free to look around.

**Live meetings:** We have several weekly meetings for pitching ideas, status updates, projects and processes, and planning forum engagement.

## What is SCRF?

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) is where academics, researchers, and industry leaders from all over the world come together to discuss research, solicit thoughtful peer review, and find new projects on which to collaborate.

Please feel free to come and introduce yourself in our [chat](https://discord.gg/7WPRb8FHvd). Another great way to introduce yourself to us is to find a thread on the [SCRF website](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) and add a well-reseasoned or insightful comment to one of the discussions.

If you would like to get some deeper insight into how we do work and what we have on the go, you can also have a look at our [public board](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5).
